This is a website for BDA 594. All of my projects for the class will be displayed here! Below are some interesting data sets and readings.

## [GHDx](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/)
The website for the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) can be found by clicking the link above.

The GHDx data set consists of surveys, censuses, vital statistics, and other health-related data. One such example is the GBD 2021, or the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021. As the world's most comprehensive collection of health-related data, there are many potential applications for this data set. For example, researchers could use data from the GBD 2021 to study outbreak patterns of different diseases around the globe in order to predict when another outbreak of a known disease may occur. 

Additionally, researchers may find similarities in symptoms that present immediately before an outbreak occurs in order to further strengthen any models created. Another potential application may be the use of data to study how disease rates are affected by global and local climate. Researchers could utilize the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) database to study the demographics of individuals afflicted by a disease and whether or not any similarities in background or location exist.

## [Introduction to Probability](https://books.google.com/books/about/Grinstead_and_Snell_s_Introduction_to_Pr.html?id=cE6FRAAACAAJ&source=kp_book_description) - Charles M. Grinstead and J. Laurie Snell
Above is a link to the Google Books page for this reading. A description of the book can be found on the page as well.

I decided to study statistics as an undergraduate at UCSB because of the probability unit in my AP Statistics class. As a kid, I loved watching basketball with my dad, and I always wondered what the chance was for any given shot to go in. I learned to accept that a player's FG%, or field goal percentage, was as close to the true probability of a shot being made as people were willing to measure. I learned in high school that probability was a part of the field of statistics, so I signed up for AP Stats. When we eventually started learning about probability, it quickly became my favorite unit in the class. Probability helped lead me on the path I chose to take after high school.

I found this book interesting because as an introduction to the field, it provides a framework to understanding one of the most fundamental yet volatile concepts in the field of statistics.
