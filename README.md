## [GHDx](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/)
The website for the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) can be found by clicking the link above.

The GHDx data set consists of surveys, censuses, vital statistics, and other health-related data. One such example is the GBD 2021, or the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021. As the world's most comprehensive collection of health-related data, there are many potential applications for this data set. For example, researchers could use data from the GBD 2021 to study outbreak patterns of different diseases around the globe in order to predict when another outbreak of a known disease may occur. Additionally, researchers may find similarities in symptoms that present immediately before an outbreak occurs in order to further strengthen any models created. Another potential application may be the use of data to study how disease rates are affected by global and local climate. Researchers could utilize the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) database to study the demographics of individuals afflicted by a disease and whether or not any similarities in background or location exist.
